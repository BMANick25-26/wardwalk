  <h2>What is a ward walk?</h2>

  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        A ward walk is a structured way to engage with doctors in your local hospital.
        You walk around the hospital and across wards, speak to doctors where they work,
        and try to reach people who do not usually engage with the BMA or with reps.
      </p>
      <p>
        You spend time chatting, deliver key messages, listen to issues, and answer questions where you can.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What good looks like</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You reach doctors who do not normally engage.</li>
        <li>You hear clear themes, not just one-off complaints.</li>
        <li>People leave knowing how to contact you and what will happen next.</li>
        <li>You do not overpromise. You take issues away and follow up properly.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Timing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Plan for around <strong>1–2 hours</strong> total, depending on hospital size.</li>
        <li>Aim for <strong>15–20 minutes per ward</strong> where you can.</li>
        <li>If a ward is too busy, move on and return later.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What it is not</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Not a confrontation with management.</li>
        <li>Not an investigation or a place to collect names.</li>
        <li>Not a promise that every issue will be fixed immediately.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <section id="prep">
  <h2>How to prep</h2>

  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        Preparation is about walking onto the ward with a plan.
        You should know which wards you are aiming for, what your main focus is,
        and how you will capture themes and follow up.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What good preparation looks like</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Aim to visit all wards over time.</li>
        <li>If you have time constraints, prioritise key wards you have not visited recently or wards with poorer engagement.</li>
        <li>Have a clear theme for the walk (pay, training, rota, workload).</li>
        <li>Bring what you need to follow up: QR code/link, contact details, and a way to note themes.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="muted" style="margin-top: 12px;">
        <a href="https://r1.dotdigital-pages.com/p/7IPW-9DA/bma-reps-campaign-materials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Common pitfalls</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Trying to cover too many topics in one walk.</li>
        <li>Turning the walk into a long debate instead of listening.</li>
        <li>Forgetting key materials and missing the chance to signpost or follow up.</li>
        <li>Overpromising outcomes.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>10-minute prep model</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Select wards:</strong> plan to cover all wards over time. If short on time, target low-engagement or not-recently-visited wards.</li>
        <li><strong>Define your focus:</strong> choose one theme so conversations stay coherent.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare questions:</strong> 3–5 open prompts that encourage real answers.</li>
        <li><strong>Gather materials:</strong> QR/contact details, campaign materials if needed, and a way to note themes.</li>
        <li><strong>Know escalation routes:</strong> be clear where issues go after the walk.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
  </div>

  <section id="during">
  <h2>What to do during the ward walk</h2>

  <p class="lead">
    Your job on the ward walk is simple.
    Reach doctors you do not normally hear from.
    Share the headlines.
    Listen properly.
    Capture issues and follow up.
  </p>

  <div class="grid">

    <div class="card">
      <h3>1. Choose the right wards first</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Start with wards that are underrepresented or have low engagement.</li>
        <li>Prioritise areas you do not hear from often.</li>
        <li>Assume low engagement can mean unmet problems, not lack of interest.</li>
        <li>If time is tight, do fewer wards properly rather than rushing every ward.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>2. Introduce yourself clearly</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Say your name and that you are a BMA representative.</li>
        <li>Be explicit about why you are there today.</li>
        <li>Keep it short. Doctors decide in the first 10 seconds if they can engage.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Example opener</strong><br>
        “Hi, I’m ...... I’m one of the local BMA reps. Is now a good time for a quick chat?”
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>3. Always check if it’s a good time</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Ask first. Do not assume you can take their time.</li>
        <li>If they are busy, do not push.</li>
        <li>Say you will come back later, then actually do it.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>If they’re too busy</strong><br>
        “No problem at all. I’ll come back later when things are calmer.”
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>4. Give the headlines</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Know the key national and local messages before you start.</li>
        <li>Keep it to 2–3 points. Do not lecture.</li>
        <li>Use plain language and avoid jargon.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Headlines structure</strong><br>
        National update → Local impact → What you want them to do next
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>5. Listen and answer questions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Ask one open question and let them speak.</li>
        <li>Listen for themes: rota gaps, training access, exception reporting, study leave.</li>
        <li>Answer what you can. Do not guess.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>It’s fine to say you don’t know</strong><br>
        “I don’t know the answer to that right now. If you’re happy, I’ll take your number and come back to you.”
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>6. Capture details for follow-up</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Only take contact details if you genuinely intend to follow up.</li>
        <li>Be clear what you will do with the information.</li>
        <li>If you are escalating via the LNC or IRO, say so.</li>
        <li>Write down the issue as a theme, not a long story.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Minimum follow-up note</strong><br>
        Ward → Issue theme → Who it needs escalating to → Contact (if needed)
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>7. Signpost: keep people connected</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Encourage doctors to join the relevant local strike and coordination groups.</li>
        <li>This keeps them up to date with national information and local actions.</li>
        <li>Make it easy: QR codes, Linktree, or a direct message.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>8. Repeat the loop until you’ve covered the hospital</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Move on. Do not get stuck on one ward.</li>
        <li>Do a second pass if you promised to return.</li>
        <li>Keep going until you have covered every ward you planned for.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Example talk track</h3>
      <div class="callout">
        “Hi, my name’s ......... I’m a BMA rep. I’m here today to talk about the current ballot.<br><br>
        The BMA is balloting to extend our strike mandate so we can continue negotiating with the government.<br><br>
        We’re uniting the profession behind a simple message: jobs and pay.<br><br>
        We’re asking you to vote yes, and to return your ballot as quickly as you can.<br><br>
        Is there anything on this ward you think the BMA needs to hear about right now?”
      </div>

      <p class="muted" style="margin-bottom:0;">
        Keep it short. Then listen.
      </p>
    </div>

 <section id="post">
  <h2>What to do after the ward walk</h2>

  <p class="lead">
    A good ward walk does not end when you leave the ward.
    What you do afterwards is what builds trust, fixes problems, and makes the next ward walk easier.
  </p>

  <div class="grid">

    <div class="card">
      <h3>1. Pause and reset</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Grab a cup of tea or water.</li>
        <li>Ward walks involve a lot of talking and listening.</li>
        <li>You deserve a short break before moving on to follow-up tasks.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>2. Let us know you’ve completed a ward walk</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Tell us that you have completed a ward walk.</li>
        <li>This helps track activity and identify where support is needed.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Action</strong><br>
        Complete the ward walk feedback form.
        <br><br>
        <em>[Link to form to be added here]</em>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>3. Escalate urgent safety issues</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>If any urgent patient safety or workload concerns came up, act on them promptly.</li>
        <li>Contact your Trust’s <strong>Guardian of Safe Working</strong>, usually by email.</li>
        <li>Do not sit on urgent safety information.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Rule of thumb</strong><br>
        If it affects safety today, escalate today.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>4. Document recurring themes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Write down the key issues that came up repeatedly.</li>
        <li>Focus on themes rather than individual stories.</li>
        <li>These themes form the baseline for improvement and future ward walks.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Examples of themes</strong><br>
        Rota gaps, exception reporting problems, training access, study leave issues
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>5. Look for quick local wins</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Some issues can be resolved quickly with the right conversation or email.</li>
        <li>This might include rota clarifications or raising issues with the Guardian of Safe Working.</li>
        <li>Small fixes build confidence and credibility.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>6. Contact your regional reps if needed</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>If anything complex or sensitive comes up, do not handle it alone.</li>
        <li>Your regional reps are there to support you.</li>
        <li>They are always happy to be contacted for advice or escalation.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>7. Close the loop</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>If you said you would follow something up, make sure you do.</li>
        <li>Update staff on what action has been taken.</li>
        <li>Closing the loop builds trust and encourages future engagement.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Close the loop means</strong><br>
        Action taken → feedback given → expectation set
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>8. Keep the IRO informed</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>If you have asked staff to complete a web form for a specific issue, let your IRO know.</li>
        <li>This allows them to watch for submissions and act promptly.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>If you’re unsure or worried</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>If you are uncertain about anything that came up, ask for advice.</li>
        <li>A quick phone call with a regional rep can prevent problems later.</li>
        <li>You are not expected to handle everything alone.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

  <section id="pizza">
  <h2>Pizza &amp; Pay</h2>

  <p class="lead">
    A Pizza &amp; Pay event is a short, informal way to reach a large number of doctors
    at once. The aim is to share key updates, listen to concerns, and signpost support
    without taking people away from clinical work for longer than necessary.
  </p>

  <div class="grid">

    <div class="card">
      <h3>1. Coordination</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Link in early with your local:<br> <strong>LNC representative</strong> <br>
            <strong>Industrial Relations Officer (IRO)</strong>. <br>
        <strong>Regional reps</strong></li>
        <li>Confirm availability, support, and budget arrangements (this MUST go through your IRO or region Chair.</li>
        <li>Clarify any local considerations early.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>2. Planning essentials</h3>

        <li>Secure a room with enough seating and space for food
            (doctors’ messes usually work well).</li>
        <li>Choose a time that maximises attendance:
          <ul>
            <li>Lunchtime</li>
            <li>Pre-teaching or post-handover slots</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Check any local permissions needed for food delivery.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Budget and dietary needs</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Confirm the budget with the BMA or IRO.</li>
        <li>Order food with clear dietary options (for example vegetarian).</li>
        <li>Include drinks, napkins, and plates to avoid mess and disruption.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>3. Promotion</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Posters in the mess.</li>
        <li>WhatsApp groups and rota groups.</li>
        <li>Email via the LNC representative.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        Messaging should be short, clear, and direct.

      <h3>4. Short talk track (5–7 minutes)</h3>
      <ul>

            study leave, or training access.</li>
        <li>What the BMA is doing now.</li>
        <li>What is coming next.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Listening section</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Open the floor for questions and concerns.</li>

        <li>Share contact details for local representatives.</li>
        <li>Ensure BMA materials are available:
          <ul>

            <li>Posters</li>
            <li>Pens</li>

        <li>Aim for around one hour in total.</li>
