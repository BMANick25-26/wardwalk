      <h2>Pizza &amp; Pay</h2>

      <p class="lead">
        A Pizza &amp; Pay event is a short, informal way to reach a large number of doctors
        at once. The aim is to share key updates, listen to concerns, and signpost support
        without taking people away from clinical work for longer than necessary.
