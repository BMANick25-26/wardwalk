          <h3>Purpose</h3>
          <p>
            A ward walk is a structured way to engage with doctors in your local hospital.
            You walk around the hospital and across wards, speak to doctors where they work,
            and try to reach people who do not usually engage with the BMA or with reps.
          </p>
          <p>
            You spend time chatting, deliver key messages, listen to issues, and answer questions where you can.
          </p>

          <h3>Why ward walks matter</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Ward walks let us hear directly from doctors about their working lives, in their own environment.</li>
            <li>They help spot recurring problems early, before issues escalate.</li>
            <li>They build visibility and trust, especially with doctors who do not engage via emails or WhatsApp.</li>
            <li>You do not need to be a BMA rep to ward walk — just someone who wants to improve pay and working conditions.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What good looks like</h3>

          <p>
            A good ward walk leaves doctors feeling listened to and taken seriously.
            Even when there is no immediate solution, people should feel clearer about what support exists and what will happen next.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>You reach doctors who do not normally engage.</li>
            <li>You hear clear themes, not just one-off complaints.</li>
            <li>People leave knowing how to contact you and what will happen next.</li>
            <li>You do not overpromise. You take issues away and follow up properly.</li>
          </ul>

            <strong>What ward walks are not</strong><br>
            Ward walks are not about telling doctors what they should think or do.
            They are not about making promises or having all the answers.
            Listening, understanding concerns, and signposting are the priority.

          <h3>Common pitfalls to avoid</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Feeling pressure to have all the answers.</li>
            <li>Trying to resolve issues immediately on the ward.</li>
            <li>Avoiding busy or disengaged wards.</li>
            <li>Letting conversations turn into venting rather than calm, supportive discussion.</li>
            <li>Failing to note recurring themes and feed them back.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 style="margin-top:16px;">Timing</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Plan for around <strong>1–2 hours</strong> total, depending on hospital size.</li>
            <li>Aim for <strong>15–20 minutes per ward</strong> where you can.</li>
            <li>If a ward is too busy, move on and return later.</li>
          </ul>
