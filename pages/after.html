      <h2>What to do after the ward walk</h2>

      <p class="lead">
        A good ward walk does not end when you leave the ward.
        What you do afterwards is what builds trust, fixes problems, and makes the next ward walk easier.
      </p>

      <div class="grid">

        <div class="card">
          <h3>1. Pause and reset</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Grab a cup of tea or water.</li>
            <li>Ward walks involve a lot of talking and listening.</li>
            <li>You deserve a short break before moving on to follow-up tasks.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>2. Let us know you’ve completed a ward walk</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Tell us that you have completed a ward walk.</li>
            <li>This helps track activity and identify where support is needed.</li>

          <h3>3. Escalate urgent safety issues</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>If any urgent patient safety or workload concerns came up, act on them promptly.</li>
            <li>Contact your Trust’s <strong>Guardian of Safe Working</strong>, usually by email.</li>
            <li>Do not sit on urgent safety information.</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="callout">
            <strong>Rule of thumb</strong><br>
            If it affects safety today, escalate today.

        <div class="card">
          <h3>4. Document recurring themes</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Write down the key issues that came up repeatedly.</li>
            <li>Focus on themes rather than individual stories.</li>
            <li>These themes form the baseline for improvement and future ward walks.</li>

          <h3>5. Look for quick local wins</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Some issues can be resolved quickly with the right conversation or email.</li>
            <li>This might include rota clarifications or raising issues with the Guardian of Safe Working.</li>
            <li>Small fixes build confidence and credibility.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>6. Contact your regional reps if needed</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>If anything complex or sensitive comes up, do not handle it alone.</li>
            <li>Your regional reps are there to support you.</li>
            <li>They are always happy to be contacted for advice or escalation.</li>

          <h3>7. Close the loop</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>If you said you would follow something up, make sure you do.</li>
            <li>Update staff on what action has been taken.</li>
            <li>Closing the loop builds trust and encourages future engagement.</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="callout">
            <strong>Close the loop means</strong><br>
            Action taken → feedback given → expectation set

        <div class="card">
          <h3>8. Keep the IRO informed</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>If you have asked staff to complete a web form for a specific issue, let your IRO know.</li>
            <li>This allows them to watch for submissions and act promptly.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>If you’re unsure or worried</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>If you are uncertain about anything that came up, ask for advice.</li>
            <li>A quick phone call with a regional rep can prevent problems later.</li>
