  <h1>Your pay buys less than when you started</h1>
  <p>
    Even in years with a “pay rise”, your salary has fallen behind inflation.
    In real terms, you are worse off than doctors doing the same job before you.
    This is cumulative and permanent unless reversed.
  </p>

  <h1>Responsibility has increased. Pay has not</h1>
  <p>
    Doctors are taking on senior clinical responsibility earlier.
    Registrars are often the most senior decision-maker on site overnight.
    The risk you carry has gone up, while real-terms pay has gone down.
  </p>

  <h1>Goodwill is being treated as unlimited</h1>
  <p>
    Staying late is routine.
    Rota gaps are normalised.
    Extra work is absorbed rather than paid.
    The system assumes doctors will continue to compensate for understaffing.
  </p>

  <h1>Training and jobs are no longer guaranteed</h1>
  <p>
    Competition ratios continue to rise while training numbers stay flat.
    Finishing foundation no longer guarantees progression.
    More doctors are pushed into non-training roles through lack of posts.
  </p>

  <h1>Calling this “moaning” avoids fixing it</h1>
  <p>
    When doctors point out pay erosion or unsafe workloads, it is often dismissed
    as attitude rather than evidence.
    No other profession is expected to quietly absorb decade-long pay cuts.
  </p>

  <h1>Nothing changes without a valid ballot mandate</h1>
  <p>
    Industrial action is only lawful with a live ballot.
    Turnout is what gives leverage.
    A weak mandate is read as acceptance of the status quo.
  </p>

  <h1>Not voting has consequences</h1>
  <p>
    If turnout drops, negotiating power drops.
    Future pay deals are shaped by what is tolerated now.
    This affects you whether you are an F1, a registrar, or near CCT.
  </p>

  <h1>The reballot is the mechanism</h1>
  <p>
    Voting takes minutes.
    It is the only direct influence doctors have collectively.
    High turnout is the message that keeps negotiations alive.
