          <h3>Your pay buys less than when you started</h3>
          <p>
            Even in years with a “pay rise”, your salary has fallen behind inflation.
            In real terms, you are worse off than doctors doing the same job before you.
            This is cumulative and permanent unless reversed.
            Wes Streeting has suggested we get a SUB-inflation pay rise this year!

          <h3>Responsibility has increased. Pay has not</h3>
          <p>
            Doctors are taking on senior clinical responsibility earlier.
            Registrars are often the most senior decision-maker on site overnight.
            The risk you carry has gone up, while real-terms pay has gone down.

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Goodwill is being treated as unlimited</h3>
          <p>
            Staying late is routine. Rota gaps are normalised.
            Extra work is absorbed rather than paid.
            The system assumes doctors will continue to compensate for understaffing.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Training and jobs are no longer guaranteed</h3>
          <p>
            Competition ratios continue to rise while training numbers stay flat.
            Finishing foundation no longer guarantees progression.
            More doctors are pushed into non-training roles through lack of posts.
            Wes Streeting didnt offer a sustainable solution to the jobs crisis and you voted no
          </p>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Calling this “moaning” avoids fixing it</h3>
          <p>
            The health secetary has insulted us by calling us Juvenile delinquents and Moaning minnies
            We CAN NOT stand for that
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Nothing changes without a valid ballot mandate</h3>
          <p>
            Industrial action is only lawful with a live ballot.
            Turnout is what gives leverage.
            A weak mandate is read as acceptance of the status quo.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Not voting has consequences</h3>
          <p>
            If turnout drops, negotiating power drops.
            Future pay deals are shaped by what is tolerated now.
            This affects you whether you are an F1, a registrar, or near CCT.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>The reballot is the mechanism</h3>
          <p>
            Voting takes minutes.
            It is the only direct influence doctors have collectively.
            High turnout is the message that keeps negotiations alive.
