      <h3>Your pay buys less than when you started</h3>
      <p>
        Even in years with a “pay rise”, your salary has fallen behind inflation.
        In real terms, you are worse off than doctors doing the same job before you.
        This is cumulative and permanent unless reversed.
      </p>

      <h3>Responsibility has increased. Pay has not</h3>
      <p>
        Doctors are taking on senior clinical responsibility earlier.
        Registrars are often the most senior decision-maker on site overnight.
        The risk you carry has gone up, while real-terms pay has gone down.

      <h3>Goodwill is being treated as unlimited</h3>
      <p>
        Staying late is routine.
        Rota gaps are normalised.
        Extra work is absorbed rather than paid.
        The system assumes doctors will continue to compensate for understaffing.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Training and jobs are no longer guaranteed</h3>
      <p>
        Competition ratios continue to rise while training numbers stay flat.
        Finishing foundation no longer guarantees progression.
        More doctors are pushed into non-training roles through lack of posts.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Calling this “moaning” avoids fixing it</h3>
      <p>
        When doctors point out pay erosion or unsafe workloads, it is often dismissed
        as attitude rather than evidence.
        No other profession is expected to quietly absorb decade-long pay cuts.

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Nothing changes without a valid ballot mandate</h3>
      <p>
        Industrial action is only lawful with a live ballot.
        Turnout is what gives leverage.
        A weak mandate is read as acceptance of the status quo.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Not voting has consequences</h3>
      <p>
        If turnout drops, negotiating power drops.
        Future pay deals are shaped by what is tolerated now.
        This affects you whether you are an F1, a registrar, or near CCT.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>The reballot is the mechanism</h3>
      <p>
        Voting takes minutes.
        It is the only direct influence doctors have collectively.
        High turnout is the message that keeps negotiations alive.
