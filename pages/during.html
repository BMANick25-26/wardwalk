      <h2>What to do during the ward walk</h2>

      <p class="lead">
        Your job on the ward walk is simple.
        Reach doctors you do not normally hear from.
        Share the headlines.
        Listen properly.
        Capture issues and follow up.
      </p>

      <div class="grid">

        <div class="card">
          <h3>1. Choose the right wards first</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Start with wards that are underrepresented or have low engagement.</li>
            <li>Prioritise areas you do not hear from often.</li>
            <li>Assume low engagement can mean unmet problems, not lack of interest.</li>
            <li>If time is tight, do fewer wards properly rather than rushing every ward.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>2. Introduce yourself clearly</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Say your name and that you are a BMA representative.</li>
            <li>Be explicit about why you are there today.</li>
            <li>Keep it short. Doctors decide in the first 10 seconds if they can engage.</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="callout">
            <strong>Example opener</strong><br>
            “Hi, I’m ...... I’m one of the local BMA reps. Is now a good time for a quick chat?”
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>3. Always check if it’s a good time</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Ask first. Do not assume you can take their time.</li>
            <li>If they are busy, do not push.</li>
            <li>Say you will come back later, then actually do it.</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="callout">
            <strong>If they’re too busy</strong><br>
            “No problem at all. I’ll come back later when things are calmer.”
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>4. Give the headlines</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Know the key national and local messages before you start.</li>
            <li>Keep it to 2–3 points. Do not lecture.</li>
            <li>Use plain language and avoid jargon.</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="callout">
            <strong>Headlines structure</strong><br>
            National update → Local impact → What you want them to do next
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>5. Listen and answer questions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Ask one open question and let them speak.</li>
            <li>Listen for themes: rota gaps, training access, exception reporting, study leave.</li>
            <li>Answer what you can. Do not guess.</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="callout">
            <strong>It’s fine to say you don’t know</strong><br>
            “I don’t know the answer to that right now. If you’re happy, I’ll take your number and come back to you.”
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>6. Capture details for follow-up</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Only take contact details if you genuinely intend to follow up.</li>
            <li>Be clear what you will do with the information.</li>
            <li>If you are escalating via the LNC or IRO, say so.</li>
            <li>Write down the issue as a theme, not a long story.</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="callout">
            <strong>Minimum follow-up note</strong><br>
            Ward → Issue theme → Who it needs escalating to → Contact (if needed)
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>7. Signpost: keep people connected</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Encourage doctors to join the relevant local strike and coordination groups.</li>
            <li>This keeps them up to date with national information and local actions.</li>
            <li>Make it easy: QR codes, Linktree, or a direct message.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>8. Repeat the loop until you’ve covered the hospital</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Move on. Do not get stuck on one ward.</li>
            <li>Do a second pass if you promised to return.</li>
            <li>Keep going until you have covered every ward you planned for.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Example talk track</h3>

          <div class="callout">
            “Hi, my name’s ......... I’m a BMA rep. I’m here today to talk about the current ballot.<br><br>
            The BMA is balloting to extend our strike mandate so we can continue negotiating with the government.<br><br>
            We’re uniting the profession behind a simple message: jobs and pay.<br><br>
            We’re asking you to vote yes, and to return your ballot as quickly as you can.<br><br>
            Is there anything on this ward you think the BMA needs to hear about right now?”
          </div>

          <p class="muted" style="margin-bottom:0;">
            Keep it short. Then listen.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>How conversations move people</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>People are persuaded by clear, consistent messages repeated over time.</li>
            <li>Doctors are more likely to listen to colleagues they know and trust.</li>
            <li>Use multiple routes: in-person, WhatsApp, posters, follow-up messages.</li>
            <li>You are not trying to win every argument — moving someone “a bit” is success.</li>
          </ul>
