          <h3>Purpose</h3>
          <p>
            Preparation is about walking onto the ward with a plan.
            You should know which wards you are aiming for, what your main focus is,
            and how you will capture themes and follow up.
          </p>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>What good preparation looks like</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Aim to visit all wards over time.</li>
            <li>If you have time constraints, prioritise key wards you have not visited recently or wards with poorer engagement.</li>
            <li>Have a clear theme for the walk (pay, training, rota, workload).</li>
            <li>Bring what you need to follow up: QR code/link, contact details, and a way to note themes.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Common pitfalls</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Trying to cover too many topics in one walk.</li>
            <li>Turning the walk into a long debate instead of listening.</li>
            <li>Forgetting key materials and missing the chance to signpost or follow up.</li>
            <li>Overpromising outcomes.</li>
            <li>Feeling pressure to have all the answers.</li>
            <li>Trying to resolve issues immediately on the ward.</li>
            <li>Avoiding busy or disengaged wards.</li>
            <li>Letting conversations turn into venting rather than calm, supportive discussion.</li>
            <li>Failing to note recurring themes and feed them back.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>10-minute prep model</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Select wards:</strong> plan to cover all wards over time. If short on time, target low-engagement or not-recently-visited wards.</li>
            <li><strong>Define your focus:</strong> choose one theme so conversations stay coherent.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare questions:</strong> 3–5 open prompts that encourage real answers.</li>
            <li><strong>Gather materials:</strong> QR/contact details, campaign materials if needed, and a way to note themes.</li>
            <li><strong>Know escalation routes:</strong> be clear where issues go after the walk.</li>
